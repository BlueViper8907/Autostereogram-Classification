# Business-Understanding:
- As the world of AI increases in its use in everyday life as we see with Tesla self driving cars, the ability for programs to understand reality through the lens of which we see it will become ever more paramount. Whether this be within our visible spectrum range or increased to the full electromagnetic spectrum, eventually we will need to 'teach' computers the ability to 'see'. This is a small branch of that greater goal. 
- A stereogram, you've likely seen these when you were at your local dentists office, a collage of what seems to be random colors and symbols in a beautiful elaborate pattern. What some people would call an optical illusion or 3D hologram. When once relaxes their eyes and shifts their focus on the image, the 3 dimensional aspects make themselves known.
- This is an experiment to see if a program can learn to 'see' the 3D image within stereograms that we humans can see. This, I would hope, would lead to a greater project of helping programs distinguish reality from fallacy.

# Data-Understanding:
- All stereogram images have been web scraped from varying websites in order to build a catalog of images to input into a model.

# Data-Preparation:
- After being scraped I separate what images I have collected into stereograms, the hidden images, and a collection of images from real life of those hidden features.
- When collection is finished I sorted my images into their subsequent sets: 
- Training set with 70% of my images
- Validation set with 15% of my images
- Test set with 15% of my images
- I rescale my images to a binary
- After verifying the size of my images I augmented the training data set and prepared for modeling.
